# 1.4: Advanced Functions and Functional Programming - Exercises

This file contains exercises to practice the concepts from lesson 1.4. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions.

## Lambda Functions

### Exercise 1: Basic Lambda
1.  Create a lambda function that takes one argument and returns its square.
2.  Assign it to a variable called `squarer`.
3.  Call the function with the number `8` and print the result.

### Exercise 2: Sorting with Lambda
You are given a list of strings: `fruits = ["mango", "apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
1.  Use the `sorted()` function and a `lambda` function to sort the list based on the *last character* of each string.
2.  Print the sorted list.

### Exercise 3: Lambda with Multiple Arguments
1.  Create a lambda function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their product.
2.  Assign it to a variable `multiplier`.
3.  Call the function with `x=7` and `y=5` and print the result.

## `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

### Exercise 4: Using `map`
1.  You have a list of temperatures in Celsius: `celsius_temps = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]`.
2.  Use the `map()` function with a `lambda` to convert each temperature to Fahrenheit. The formula is `(C * 9/5) + 32`.
3.  Convert the map object to a list and print it.
4.  Use a list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way.

### Exercise 5: Using `filter`
1.  You have a list of numbers: `numbers = [1, 15, 22, 37, 44, 59, 60, 72]`.
2.  Use the `filter()` function with a `lambda` to get only the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3.
3.  Convert the filter object to a list and print it.
4.  Use a list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way.

### Exercise 6: Using `reduce`
1.  You have a list of numbers: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2.  Import `reduce` from the `functools` module.
3.  Use `reduce` with a `lambda` function to find the sum of all the numbers in the list.
4.  Print the result.

## List, Dictionary, and Set Comprehensions

### Exercise 7: List Comprehension
1.  Use a list comprehension to create a list of the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10.

### Exercise 8: List Comprehension with Condition
1.  You have a list of words: `words = ["Programming", "is", "fun", "and", "powerful"]`.
2.  Use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the words that have more than 5 characters.

### Exercise 9: Dictionary Comprehension
1.  Create a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 1 to 5 and the values are their corresponding factorials (e.g., `5! = 1*2*3*4*5`). You might want to write a small helper function for the factorial.
    *Hint: You can create a dictionary comprehension that calls a function.*

### Exercise 10: Set Comprehension
1.  You have a list of numbers with duplicates: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 1]`.
2.  Use a set comprehension to create a set of the squares of the unique numbers in the list.

## Error Handling

### Exercise 11: Basic `try...except`
1.  Write a program that asks the user to enter an index.
2.  Use a list `my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]`.
3.  Use a `try...except` block to handle the `IndexError` that might occur if the user enters an invalid index. Print a friendly error message.
4.  Also, handle the `ValueError` if the user enters something that is not a number.

### Exercise 12: `try...except...else...finally`
1.  Write a function `divide(a, b)` that attempts to return `a / b`.
2.  Use a `try...except...else...finally` block.
3.  If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, print an error message.
4.  If the division is successful (no error), the `else` block should print the result.
5.  The `finally` block should always print "Division attempt finished."

## Raising Exceptions and Assertions

### Exercise 13: Raising an Exception
1.  Write a function `check_password_strength(password)`.
2.  Inside the function, if the length of the password is less than 8 characters, `raise` a `ValueError` with the message "Password is too short!".
3.  If the password is long enough, print "Password is strong."
4.  Call this function inside a `try...except` block to test it with a short password and a long password.

### Exercise 14: Using `assert`
1.  Write a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)`.
2.  Use an `assert` statement to ensure that the `discount_percent` is between 0 and 100 (inclusive). If not, the assertion message should be "Invalid discount percentage."
3.  The function should calculate and return the final price.
4.  Test the function with a valid discount (e.g., 20) and an invalid one (e.g., 110).
