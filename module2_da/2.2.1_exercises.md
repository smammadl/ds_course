# 2.2.1: Pandas Series - Exercises

This file contains exercises to practice the concepts from lesson 2.2.1. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions. You will need to have `pandas` installed (`pip install pandas`) and import it, usually as `pd`.

## Creating Pandas Series

### Exercise 1: Create a Series from a List
1.  Import the `pandas` library and alias it as `pd`.
2.  Create a simple Python list of numbers: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.
3.  Create a pandas Series from this list and print it.

### Exercise 2: Create a Series with a Custom Index
1.  Create a list of values: `[5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0]`.
2.  Create a list of corresponding index labels: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.
3.  Create a pandas Series using both the values and the index labels, then print it.

### Exercise 3: Create a Series from a Dictionary
1.  Create a dictionary representing the population of three cities: `{'London': 8.9, 'Paris': 2.1, 'New York': 8.4}` (population in millions).
2.  Create a pandas Series from this dictionary and print it.

## Indexing and Slicing

### Exercise 4: Accessing Elements
1.  Using the Series from Exercise 2, access the element with the label 'c' using the `.loc` attribute.
2.  Access the second element (at integer position 1) using the `.iloc` attribute.
3.  What happens if you try to access `my_series[1]`? Is it using the label or the position?

### Exercise 5: Slicing a Series
1.  Create a Series of the first 10 letters of the alphabet as values and their corresponding integer positions (0-9) as the index.
2.  Slice the Series to get the elements from index 3 to 6 (inclusive).
3.  Slice the Series to get every second element.

## Series Operations

### Exercise 6: Arithmetic and Broadcasting
1.  Create a Series `s1` with values `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
2.  Create another Series `s2` with values `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
3.  Add `s1` and `s2` together and print the result.
4.  Multiply the `s1` Series by 5 (demonstrating broadcasting) and print the result.

### Exercise 7: Automatic Alignment
1.  Create a Series `s3` with values `[10, 20]` and index `['a', 'b']`.
2.  Create a Series `s4` with values `[30, 40]` and index `['b', 'c']`.
3.  Add `s3` and `s4` together. Observe the result and explain why `NaN` values are present.

## Conditional Logic and Filtering

### Exercise 8: Boolean Indexing
1.  Create a Series of random integers between -10 and 10. You can use `np.random.randint(-10, 11, size=10)` after importing numpy.
2.  Use boolean indexing to select and print only the positive numbers from the Series.

### Exercise 9: Using `.where()`
1.  Using the same Series from Exercise 8, use the `.where()` method to replace all negative numbers with 0, while keeping the positive numbers as they are.
2.  Print the modified Series.

## Useful Methods

### Exercise 10: Value Counts
1.  Create a Series containing the following list of letters: `['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'd', 'a']`.
2.  Use the `.value_counts()` method to count the occurrences of each unique letter.

### Exercise 11: Applying a Function
1.  Create a Series of numbers: `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`.
2.  Use the `.apply()` method with a `lambda` function to calculate the square root of each number in the Series.

### Exercise 12: Series Utilities
1.  Create a Series with some duplicate values and a few `NaN`s: `pd.Series([10, 20, 10, 30, np.nan, 40, np.nan, 20])`.
2.  Use `.nunique()` to find the number of unique values (ignoring `NaN`).
3.  Use `.isnull().sum()` to count the total number of missing values.
4.  Use `.sort_values()` to sort the Series.
5.  Use `.dropna()` to get a new Series with the missing values removed.
