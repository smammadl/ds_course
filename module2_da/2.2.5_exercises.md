# 2.2.5: Pandas String and DateTime Manipulation - Exercises

This file contains exercises to practice the concepts from lesson 2.2.5. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions. You will need to have `pandas` and `numpy` installed.

## Vectorized String Operations

### Exercise 1: Basic String Methods
1.  Import `pandas` and `numpy`.
2.  Create a Pandas Series:
    ```python
    names = pd.Series(['Alice Smith', 'Bob Jones', 'Charlie Brown', 'David Wilson'])
    ```
3.  Convert all names to lowercase.
4.  Convert all names to uppercase.
5.  Calculate the length of each name.

### Exercise 2: Splitting and Slicing Strings
1.  Using the `names` Series from Exercise 1, split each name into a list of first and last names.
2.  Extract just the first name (the first element of the split list) for each person.
3.  Extract the first 3 characters of each name.

### Exercise 3: String Filtering
1.  Check which names start with the letter 'C'.
2.  Check which names contain the string 'Jones'.

## Date/Time Manipulation

### Exercise 4: Creating and Formatting Dates
1.  Create a datetime object for January 1, 2023, using Python's `datetime` module.
2.  Convert this datetime object to a string in the format "Day-Month-Year" (e.g., "01-January-2023").
3.  Use `pd.to_datetime()` to convert the string "2023-05-15" into a Pandas Timestamp.

### Exercise 5: Date Arithmetic and Ranges
1.  Create a Pandas Timestamp for today.
2.  Add 7 days to this timestamp.
3.  Create a range of dates from January 1, 2023, to January 10, 2023, using `pd.date_range()`.
4.  Create a range of 5 monthly periods starting from January 2023.

### Exercise 6: Indexing by Time
1.  Create a Series with a DatetimeIndex:
    ```python
    dates = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=6, freq='D')
    data = pd.Series([10, 12, 15, 14, 18, 20], index=dates)
    ```
2.  Select the data for January 3, 2023.
3.  Select the data from January 2 to January 5, 2023.

## Time Series Analysis

### Exercise 7: Resampling
1.  Create a DataFrame with daily data:
    ```python
    dates = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=100, freq='D')
    df = pd.DataFrame({'Value': np.random.randn(100)}, index=dates)
    ```
2.  Resample the data to a monthly frequency ('M') and calculate the mean for each month.
3.  Resample the data to a weekly frequency ('W') and calculate the sum for each week.

### Exercise 8: Shifting and Rolling Windows
1.  Using the DataFrame from Exercise 7, create a new column 'Shifted_Value' that shifts the 'Value' column by 1 day.
2.  Calculate the 7-day rolling mean of the 'Value' column and store it in a new column 'Rolling_Mean'.
3.  Print the first 10 rows to see the effect of shifting and rolling.
