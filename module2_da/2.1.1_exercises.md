# 2.1: NumPy - Exercises

## NumPy Array Creation

### Exercise 1: Creating Arrays
1.  Import the `numpy` library and alias it as `np`.
2.  Create a 1D NumPy array named `arr1` from the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
3.  Create a 2D NumPy array (2x3) named `arr2` from the nested list `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.
4.  Create a 1D array `arr3` of 10 zeros.
5.  Create a 2D array `arr4` of shape (3, 4) filled with ones.
6.  Create an array `arr5` with numbers from 0 to 9.
    *Hint: Use `np.arange()`.*
7.  Create an array `arr6` of 5 numbers evenly spaced between 0 and 1.
    *Hint: Use `np.linspace()`.*

## Array Attributes and Indexing

### Exercise 2: Array Attributes
1.  Create a 3x3 NumPy array with random integers between 1 and 100.
2.  Print the array's `shape`.
3.  Print the array's `ndim` (number of dimensions).
4.  Print the array's `size` (total number of elements).
5.  Print the array's `dtype` (data type of the elements).

### Exercise 3: Indexing and Slicing
1.  Create a 1D array `a` with numbers from 10 to 19.
2.  Access the element at index 3.
3.  Access the elements from index 2 to 5.
4.  Create a 2D array `b` of shape (4, 4) with numbers from 1 to 16.
5.  Access the element in the second row, third column.
6.  Slice the subarray consisting of the first two rows and the last two columns.
7.  Access the entire third column.
