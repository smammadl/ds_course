# 1.5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Exercises

This file contains exercises to practice the concepts from lesson 1.5. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions.

## Creating Classes

### Exercise 1: Basic Class and Object
1.  Define a class named `Car`.
2.  Inside the class, add a class attribute `wheels = 4`.
3.  Add two instance methods: `drive()` which prints "The car is moving", and `stop()` which prints "The car has stopped".
4.  Create an object (instance) of the `Car` class called `my_car`.
5.  Call the `drive()` and `stop()` methods on your object.

### Exercise 2: The `__init__` Method
1.  Modify the `Car` class from Exercise 1.
2.  Remove the `drive` and `stop` methods for now.
3.  Add an `__init__` method that takes `make`, `model`, and `year` as arguments.
4.  Inside `__init__`, create instance attributes for `make`, `model`, and `year`.
5.  Add a method `describe()` that returns a string like "This is a 2020 Ford Mustang."
6.  Create an instance of your new `Car` class and print the result of its `describe()` method.

## Inheritance

### Exercise 3: Basic Inheritance
1.  Create a new class called `ElectricCar` that inherits from the `Car` class (from Exercise 2).
2.  Add a new `__init__` method to `ElectricCar`. It should accept `make`, `model`, `year`, and `battery_size`.
3.  Inside the `ElectricCar`'s `__init__`, call the parent class's `__init__` method to handle `make`, `model`, and `year`.
    *Hint: Use `super().__init__(...)`.*
4.  Assign `battery_size` as a new instance attribute.
5.  Create an instance of `ElectricCar` and test that it works.

### Exercise 4: Method Overriding
1.  In your `ElectricCar` class, override the `describe()` method from the parent `Car` class.
2.  The new `describe()` method should include information about the battery size, like: "This is a 2022 Tesla Model S with a 100kWh battery."
3.  Create an instance of `ElectricCar` and call the overridden `describe()` method to see the new output.

## Polymorphism and Encapsulation

### Exercise 5: Polymorphism
1.  Create a `FuelCar` class that also inherits from `Car`.
2.  Give both `ElectricCar` and `FuelCar` a method with the same name, `refuel()`. 
    - For `ElectricCar`, `refuel()` should print "The car is charging."
    - For `FuelCar`, `refuel()` should print "The car is refueling."
3.  Create a `for` loop that iterates over a list containing one `ElectricCar` object and one `FuelCar` object, and calls the `refuel()` method on each.

### Exercise 6: Encapsulation
1.  Create a `BankAccount` class.
2.  In the `__init__` method, it should accept an `owner` name and an initial `balance`.
3.  Make the `balance` attribute "private" using name mangling (e.g., `__balance`).
4.  Create a `deposit(amount)` method that adds to the balance.
5.  Create a `withdraw(amount)` method that subtracts from the balance but prevents the balance from going below zero.
6.  Create a `get_balance()` method that returns the current balance.
7.  Test your class by creating an account, making deposits and withdrawals, and trying to withdraw more money than is in the account.

## More Class Practice

### Exercise 7: Line Class
1.  Create a `Line` class that is initialized with two tuples, `point1` and `point2`, representing (x, y) coordinates.
2.  Add a method `calculate_length()` that returns the length of the line.
    *Hint: The distance formula is `sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)`. You may need to `import math`.*
3.  Add a method `calculate_slope()` that returns the slope of the line.
    *Hint: The slope formula is `(y2-y1) / (x2-x1)`.*

### Exercise 8: Rectangle Class
1.  Create a `Rectangle` class initialized with `width` and `height`.
2.  Add a method `calculate_area()` that returns the area (`width * height`).
3.  Add a method `calculate_perimeter()` that returns the perimeter (`2 * (width + height)`).

### Exercise 9: Cylinder Class
1.  Create a `Cylinder` class initialized with `radius` and `height`.
2.  Add a method `calculate_volume()` that returns the volume.
    *Hint: The volume formula is `pi * radius^2 * height`. You can use `math.pi`.*
3.  Add a method `calculate_surface_area()` that returns the surface area.
    *Hint: The surface area formula is `2 * pi * radius * (radius + height)`.*

## Special Methods

### Exercise 10: `__str__` and `__len__`
1.  Create a `Book` class with an `__init__` method that takes `title`, `author`, and `pages`.
2.  Implement the `__str__` special method to return a user-friendly string representation, e.g., `"'The Hobbit' by J.R.R. Tolkien, 310 pages"`.
3.  Implement the `__len__` special method to return the number of pages in the book.
4.  Create a `Book` object and test both `print(my_book)` and `len(my_book)`.

## Data Classes

### Exercise 11: Using `@dataclass`
1.  Import `dataclass` from the `dataclasses` module.
2.  Re-create the `Book` class from the previous exercise, but this time as a data class using the `@dataclass` decorator.
3.  You only need to define the attributes with their type hints (`title: str`, `author: str`, `pages: int`). The `__init__` and `__repr__` (similar to `__str__`) methods will be created for you.
4.  Create two `Book` objects with the same attributes and check if they are equal using `==`. (The `__eq__` method is also auto-generated).
5.  Print one of the objects to see its string representation.
