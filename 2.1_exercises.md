# 2.1: NumPy - Exercises

This file contains exercises to practice the concepts from lesson 2.1. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions. You will need to have `numpy` installed (`pip install numpy`) and import it, usually as `np`.

## NumPy Array Creation

### Exercise 1: Creating Arrays
1.  Import the `numpy` library and alias it as `np`.
2.  Create a 1D NumPy array named `arr1` from the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
3.  Create a 2D NumPy array (2x3) named `arr2` from the nested list `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.
4.  Create a 1D array `arr3` of 10 zeros.
5.  Create a 2D array `arr4` of shape (3, 4) filled with ones.
6.  Create an array `arr5` with numbers from 0 to 9.
    *Hint: Use `np.arange()`.*
7.  Create an array `arr6` of 5 numbers evenly spaced between 0 and 1.
    *Hint: Use `np.linspace()`.*

## Array Attributes and Indexing

### Exercise 2: Array Attributes
1.  Create a 3x3 NumPy array with random integers between 1 and 100.
2.  Print the array's `shape`.
3.  Print the array's `ndim` (number of dimensions).
4.  Print the array's `size` (total number of elements).
5.  Print the array's `dtype` (data type of the elements).

### Exercise 3: Indexing and Slicing
1.  Create a 1D array `a` with numbers from 10 to 19.
2.  Access the element at index 3.
3.  Access the elements from index 2 to 5.
4.  Create a 2D array `b` of shape (4, 4) with numbers from 1 to 16.
5.  Access the element in the second row, third column.
6.  Slice the subarray consisting of the first two rows and the last two columns.
7.  Access the entire third column.

## Array Operations and Universal Functions (ufuncs)

### Exercise 4: Basic Arithmetic
1.  Create two 1D arrays, `x = np.array([1, 2, 3])` and `y = np.array([4, 5, 6])`.
2.  Add `x` and `y` together.
3.  Multiply `x` by 3.
4.  Calculate the square of each element in `x`.

### Exercise 5: Universal Functions
1.  Create a 1D array `z` with the values `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`.
2.  Calculate the square root of each element in `z` using a NumPy function.
3.  Create a 1D array of angles in radians: `angles = np.array([0, np.pi/2, np.pi])`.
4.  Calculate the sine of each angle in the `angles` array.

## Broadcasting and Aggregate Functions

### Exercise 6: Broadcasting
1.  Create a 2D array `matrix` of shape (3, 3) with values from 1 to 9.
2.  Create a 1D array `vector` with values `[10, 20, 30]`.
3.  Add the `vector` to the `matrix`. Observe how broadcasting works.
4.  Try to add `np.array([100, 200])` to the `matrix`. What happens and why?

### Exercise 7: Aggregate Functions
1.  Create a 2D array `data` of shape (3, 5) with random integers.
2.  Calculate the sum of all elements in `data`.
3.  Calculate the mean of all elements.
4.  Find the maximum value in the array.
5.  Calculate the sum of elements for each column.
    *Hint: Use the `axis` parameter.*
6.  Calculate the mean for each row.

## Reshaping and Stacking

### Exercise 8: Reshaping Arrays
1.  Create a 1D array with 12 elements, from 0 to 11.
2.  Reshape this array into a 3x4 2D array.
3.  Reshape it again into a 4x3 array.
4.  Finally, reshape it into a 3D array of shape (2, 2, 3).

### Exercise 9: Stacking Arrays
1.  Create two 2x2 arrays, `m1` and `m2`.
2.  Stack them horizontally using `np.hstack()`.
3.  Stack them vertically using `np.vstack()`.

## Advanced Operations

### Exercise 10: Boolean Indexing
1.  Create a 1D array `nums` with integers from -5 to 5.
2.  Create a boolean mask to select only the positive numbers from `nums`.
3.  Use the mask to print the positive numbers.
4.  In one line, set all the negative numbers in `nums` to 0. Print the modified `nums` array.

### Exercise 11: Dot Product and Matrix Multiplication
1.  Create two 1D arrays (vectors) `v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])` and `v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])`.
2.  Calculate the dot product of `v1` and `v2`.
3.  Create two 2x2 matrices, `mat1` and `mat2`.
4.  Perform matrix multiplication on `mat1` and `mat2` using the `@` operator.
5.  Perform the same matrix multiplication using `np.dot()`.
