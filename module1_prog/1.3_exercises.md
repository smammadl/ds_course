## Dictionaries

### Exercise 1: Dictionary Basics
1.  Create a dictionary named `movie` to represent your favorite movie. It should include keys for "title", "director", "year", and "genre".
2.  Print the value of the "title" key.
3.  Add a new key-value pair for "rating" with a value (e.g., 8.5).
4.  Change the "year" to a new value.
5.  Remove the "genre" key from the dictionary.
6.  Print the final `movie` dictionary.

### Exercise 2: Dictionary Methods
1.  Using the `movie` dictionary from Exercise 1, print all the keys.
2.  Print all the values.
3.  Print all the key-value pairs as tuples.
4.  Use the `.get()` method to try to access the "producer" key. Provide a default value of "Unknown" if the key doesn't exist. Print the result.
5.  Check if the "director" key is in the dictionary and print the result (`True` or `False`).

### Exercise 3: Nested Dictionaries
1.  Create a dictionary called `employees` that contains information about two employees. Each employee should be a key (their name), and the value should be another dictionary with keys for "role" and "salary".
    ```
    Example structure:
    {
        "Alice": {"role": "Developer", "salary": 80000},
        "Bob": {"role": "Designer", "salary": 75000}
    }
    ```
2.  Access and print Alice's role.
3.  Update Bob's salary to 78000.
4.  Add a new employee, Charlie, with the role "Manager" and a salary of 90000.
5.  Print the final `employees` dictionary.

## Sets

### Exercise 4: Set Creation and Properties
1.  Create a list of numbers with duplicates: `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40, 10, 50]`.
2.  Create a set from this list to get only the unique numbers. Print the set.
3.  Add the number `60` to the set.
4.  Try to add the number `10` to the set again. What happens? (Conceptual question)
5.  Print the final set.

### Exercise 5: Set Operations
Given the following two sets:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```
1.  Find the union of the two sets and print it.
2.  Find the intersection of the two sets and print it.
3.  Find the difference between `set1` and `set2` (`set1 - set2`) and print it.
4.  Find the difference between `set2` and `set1` (`set2 - set1`) and print it.
5.  Find the symmetric difference of `set2` and `set1` print it. (using method and formula)

## Functions

### Exercise 6: Basic Function
1.  Write a function called `print_greeting` that takes no arguments and prints the string "Hello, world!".
2.  Call the function to see its output.

### Exercise 7: Function with Arguments and Return Value
1.  Write a function called `calculate_area` that takes two arguments, `width` and `height`.
2.  The function should calculate the area (`width * height`) and return the result.
3.  Call the function with `width=5` and `height=10` and store the result in a variable called `area`.
4.  Print the `area` variable.

### Exercise 8: Function with Default Arguments
1.  Create a function `send_email` that takes `recipient`, `subject`, and `body` as arguments.
2.  Give the `subject` a default value of "No Subject".
3.  The function should print a formatted string like:
    ```
    To: [recipient]
    Subject: [subject]
    Body: [body]
    ```
4.  Call the function once with all arguments.
5.  Call the function again without providing a `subject`.

### Exercise 9: Function with Logic
1.  Write a function `is_positive` that takes a number as an argument.
2.  The function should return `True` if the number is greater than 0, and `False` otherwise.
3.  Test the function with a positive number, a negative number, and zero.

### Exercise 10: Combining Concepts
1.  Write a function `find_long_words` that takes a list of strings and an integer `min_length` as arguments.
2.  The function should return a new list containing only the words from the original list that are longer than `min_length`.
3.  Test your function with `words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]` and `min_length = 5`.

## Scope of Variables

### Exercise 11: Scope
Predict the output of the following code snippet without running it. Explain your reasoning.
```python
x = 50

def update_x():
    x = 100
    print(f"Inside function: x = {x}")

update_x()
print(f"Outside function: x = {x}")
```

### Exercise 12: The `global` Keyword
1.  Modify the function from Exercise 11. Use the `global` keyword so that the function `update_x` modifies the global `x` variable.
2.  Predict the new output and then verify by writing the code.
```python
x = 50

def update_x_global():
    # Your code here to modify global x
    pass # Remove this line

update_x_global()
print(f"Outside function: x = {x}")
```
