## Basic Operators

### Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operators
What are the results of the following expressions?
1.  `10 + 5 * 3`
2.  `(10 + 5) * 3`
3.  `20 / 4`
4.  `20 // 4`
5.  `21 // 4`
6.  `21 % 4`
7.  `2 ** 5`

### Exercise 2: Operator Precedence
Predict the output of the following expression without running it in Python:
`5 + 3 * 2 - 8 / 4 ** 2`

### Exercise 3: Comparison Operators
Write Python code to check the following. Your code should print `True` or `False`.
1.  Is 50 greater than 100?
2.  Is 33 equal to 33.0?
3.  Is "hello" not equal to "world"?
4.  Is the length of "python" greater than or equal to 5?

## Variables and Data Types

### Exercise 1: Variables
1.  Create a variable named `city` and assign it the value "New York".
2.  Print the value of the `city` variable.
3.  Change the value of `city` to "London" and print it again.

### Exercise 2: Assignment Operators
1.  Create a variable `score` with a value of `100`.
2.  Using an assignment operator, subtract 25 from `score`.
3.  Using an assignment operator, multiply `score` by 2.
4.  Print the final `score`.

### Exercise 3: Variable Naming
Which of the following variable names are invalid? Explain why.
1.  `1st_place`
2.  `first-place`
3.  `_first_place`
4.  `for`
5.  `FirstPlace`

### Exercise 4: Data Types
What is the data type of each of the following values?
1.  `99`
2.  `"99"`
3.  `99.0`
4.  `False`
5.  `None`

### Exercise 5: Type Conversion
1.  You are given a variable `price_str = "25.99"`. Convert it to a float and store it in a variable named `price_float`.
2.  You have a variable `quantity = 3`. Convert it to a string.
3.  Concatenate the string from step 2 with the text " items".

## Strings in Detail

### Exercise 1: Concatenation and Replication
1.  Create two variables, `first_name` and `last_name`, with your names.
2.  Create a `full_name` variable by concatenating them with a space in between.
3.  Create a `separator` string that is 30 dashes (`-`) long using string replication.
4.  Print the `full_name` and then the `separator`.

### Exercise 2: Escape Characters
Create a single string that, when printed, displays the following output:
```
The file is located at:
C:\Users\new_folder\tabbed_file.txt
He said, "It's a beautiful day."
```

### Exercise 3: Indexing and Slicing
Given the string `s = "Programming is fun!"`:
1.  What character is at index 4?
2.  What is the last character of the string?
3.  What substring do you get from slicing `s[11:13]`?
4.  How can you get the substring "gram"?
5.  How can you reverse the entire string?

### Exercise 4: String Methods
Given the string `tweet = "  WOW, what a great game! #sports #python  "`:
1.  Convert the entire tweet to lowercase.
2.  Remove the leading and trailing whitespace.
3.  Replace "#python" with "#DataScience".
4.  Split the cleaned tweet into a list of words.

## Basic Input and Output

### Exercise 1: User Greeting
1.  Write a program that asks the user for their name.
2.  Print a personalized greeting, like "Hello, [Name]!".

### Exercise 2: Age Calculator
1.  Ask the user for the current year.
2.  Ask the user for their birth year.
3.  Calculate and print their age. Make sure to handle the input as numbers.

### Exercise 3: Formatted Output
1.  Create variables for `item = "Laptop"`, `price = 1200.50`, and `quantity = 2`.
2.  Calculate the `total_cost`.
3.  Print a summary using an f-string that looks like this:
    `Item: Laptop, Quantity: 2, Total Cost: $2,401.00`
    (Note the comma for thousands and two decimal places for the cost).
