# 1.2: Data Structures and Control Flow - Exercises

This file contains exercises to practice the concepts from lesson 1.2. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions.

## Lists

### Exercise 1: List Creation and Access
1.  Create a list named `colors` containing the strings "red", "green", "blue", "yellow", and "purple".
2.  Print the third item in the list.
3.  Using negative indexing, print the last item in the list.
4.  Create a new list `primary_colors` by slicing `colors` to get the first three colors ("red", "green", "blue"). Print the new list.

### Exercise 2: List Modification
1.  Start with the `colors` list from Exercise 1.
2.  Change the "yellow" color to "magenta".
3.  Add the color "cyan" to the end of the list.
4.  Use the `.insert()` method to add "orange" at the second position (index 1).
5.  Remove "blue" from the list.
6.  Print the final `colors` list.

### Exercise 3: Nested Lists
1. Create a nested list called `tic_tac_toe` representing a 3x3 board.
   ```
   [['X', 'O', 'X'],
    ['O', 'X', 'O'],
    ['X', 'O', ' ']]
   ```
2. Access and print the center element of the board ('X').
3. Change the empty space ' ' in the bottom-right corner to 'O'.
4. Print the modified board.

## Tuples

### Exercise 4: Tuples
1. Create a tuple named `weekdays` containing the days of the week from "Monday" to "Friday".
2. Try to change "Monday" to "Funday". What happens and why? (This is a conceptual question).
3. Print the fourth day of the week from the tuple.

## Conditional Statements

### Exercise 5: Grading Program
Write a program that takes a numerical grade (0-100) and prints the corresponding letter grade based on the following scale:
- 90-100: "A"
- 80-89: "B"
- 70-79: "C"
- 60-69: "D"
- Below 60: "F"

Test your program with the grades `95`, `82`, `78`, `61`, and `45`.

### Exercise 6: Logical Operators
Predict the output of the following code snippets without running them. Then, verify your answers.
```python
print((10 > 5) and (5 < 3))
print((10 > 5) or (5 < 3))
print(not (5 == 5))
print(1 < 3 < 5)
print(1 < 3 and 3 > 5)
```

## Loops

### Exercise 7: `for` Loop
1. Create a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
2. Write a `for` loop that iterates through the list and prints only the even numbers.

### Exercise 8: `while` Loop
Write a `while` loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints "Liftoff!".

### Exercise 9: `break` and `continue`
Using a `for` loop and the `range()` function, print numbers from 1 to 20.
- If a number is a multiple of 3, skip it and continue to the next number.
- If a number is greater than 15, break out of the loop.

## List Comprehensions

### Exercise 10: Simple List Comprehension
Use a list comprehension to create a new list called `first_letters` that contains the first letter of each word in the following list: `words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]`.

### Exercise 11: List Comprehension with Condition
Given a list of numbers `numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7, -8]`, use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the positive numbers.

### Exercise 12: List Comprehension with `if-else`
Given the same `numbers` list from the previous exercise, use a list comprehension to create a new list. If a number is positive, keep it. If it's negative, replace it with the string "negative".
Expected output: `[1, 'negative', 3, 'negative', 5, 'negative', 7, 'negative']`

### Exercise 13: Nested List Comprehension
Given the matrix `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, use a nested list comprehension to create a new list where each number is doubled.
Expected output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]`
