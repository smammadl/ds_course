# 1.1: Introduction to Python and Basic Concepts

## Introduction to Programming

### What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to execute. These instructions, written in a programming language, tell the computer how to perform a task or solve a problem. Think of it as creating a recipe for the computer to follow.

### What is Data Analytics?

Data Analytics focuses on examining large datasets to find trends, answer questions, and draw conclusions. It often involves creating dashboards and reports to visualize the findings. The primary goal is to make sense of past data to inform business decisions. For example, a company might analyze sales data to understand which products are most popular in different regions.

### What is Data Science?

Data Science is a broader field that encompasses data analytics. It involves using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Data scientists not only analyze data but also use advanced techniques, like machine learning, to make predictions about the future.

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. It focuses on building algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing rules, you feed data to the algorithm, and it learns the patterns itself. For example, an email spam filter is a machine learning model that learns to identify junk mail based on past examples.

### Why Python for Data Science?

Python has become the de-facto language for data science for several key reasons:

*   **Simplicity and Readability:** Python's syntax is clean and intuitive, making it relatively easy for beginners to learn. It reads almost like plain English.
*   **Extensive Libraries:** Python boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries specifically designed for data science, such as:
    *   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   **NumPy:** For numerical operations, especially with arrays.
    *   **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.
    *   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms.
*   **Versatility:** Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it's not just for data science. You can build web applications, automate tasks, and more.
*   **Large Community:** A massive and active global community means you can easily find help, tutorials, and solutions to problems.

### Python's Role in Different Fields

| Field                 | Python's Strengths                                                                      | Main Drawbacks                                      | Popular Alternatives                               |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Programming** | Versatile, easy to learn, large standard library, strong for web development (Django, Flask). | Slower performance compared to compiled languages.  | Java, C++, JavaScript, Go                            |
| **Data Analytics**      | Excellent libraries (Pandas, NumPy), great for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration. | Can be memory-intensive with very large datasets.   | R, SQL, Excel, Tableau                             |

| **Machine Learning**    | Dominant language with top-tier libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).           | Not ideal for low-level or embedded ML systems.     | C++, R, Julia                                      |

## Setting up the Environment

### Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (like Python) and runtimes.

1.  **Download:** Visit the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for Windows.
2.  **Install:** Run the installer. It is recommended to accept the default settings, but make sure to check the "Add to PATH" option so you can open VS Code from the command line.

### Installing Git

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code. It's an essential tool for collaboration and for managing different versions of your projects.

1.  **Download:** Visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the installer for Windows.
2.  **Install:** Run the installer. The default options are suitable for most users. This will also install Git Bash, a command-line tool for using Git.

### Installing Miniconda

Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda, a package and environment manager. It's recommended over Anaconda for beginners as it's lightweight and installs only the essentials.

1.  **Download:** Visit the [Miniconda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2.  **Install:** Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. It's recommended to accept the default settings.

Alternatively, 
1. **Press windows key**
2. type *powershell*
3. in powershell copy and paste following after `>`
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe" -outfile ".\miniconda.exe"
Start-Process -FilePath ".\miniconda.exe" -ArgumentList "/S" -Wait
del .\miniconda.exe
```

### Installing Scoop (For future reference)
1. **Press windows key**
2. type *powershell* and open it
3. in powershell copy and paste following `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` and then press Enter.
4. copy and paste following `Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression`

### Creating and Managing Environments

One of the key features of `conda` is its ability to create isolated environments. This means you can have different versions of Python and packages for different projects without them interfering with each other.

1.  **Create a new environment:** Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and type the following command. We'll name our environment `ds_env` (for data science environment) and install Python 3.9.

    ```bash
    conda create --name ds_env python=3.11
    ```

2.  **Activate the environment:** Before you can use the new environment, you need to activate it.

    ```bash
    conda activate ds_env
    ```
    Your terminal prompt should now change to show the name of the active environment (e.g., `(ds_env) C:\Users\user>`).

3.  **Install packages:** With the environment active, you can now install packages into it. Let's install Jupyter Notebook.

    ```bash
    conda install jupyter
    ```

4.  **Deactivate the environment:** When you're done working, you can deactivate the environment to return to the base environment.

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    ```

### Using Conda Environments in VS Code

Visual Studio Code has excellent integration with Python and Conda.

1.  **Open your project folder** in VS Code.
2.  **Select the Python interpreter:** Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for `Python: Select Interpreter`. You should see your `ds_env` conda environment in the list. Select it.
3.  **Create a new Jupyter Notebook:** You can now create a `.ipynb` file in VS Code. When you run a cell for the first time, VS Code will use the selected interpreter (`ds_env`) and its packages.

### Navigating Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that allow you to write and run code, add explanatory text, and create visualizations all in one place.

*   **Launch:** Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and type:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
*   **Interface:** Your web browser will open the Jupyter dashboard, showing files in the current directory.
*   **Create a Notebook:** Click "New" in the top-right corner and select "Python 3" (or similar).
*   **Cells:** Notebooks are composed of cells.
    *   **Code Cells:** Where you write and execute Python code.
    *   **Markdown Cells:** Where you can write formatted text, like this document.
*   **Run a Cell:** To execute a cell, select it and press `Shift + Enter`.

#### Modes and Shortcuts

Jupyter has two main modes:

*   **Command Mode (blue cell border):** Press `Esc` to enter. Allows you to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type in individual cells.
*   **Edit Mode (green cell border):** Press `Enter` to enter. Allows you to type code or text into a cell.

Here are some essential shortcuts:

| Shortcut              | Action (in Command Mode)                                  |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`                   | Insert a new cell above the current cell.                 |
| `B`                   | Insert a new cell below the current cell.                 |
| `M`                   | Change the current cell to a Markdown cell.               |
| `Y`                   | Change the current cell to a Code cell.                   |
| `DD`                  | Delete the current cell.                                  |
| `Z`                   | Undo the last cell deletion.                              |
| `Shift + Up/Down`     | Select multiple cells.                                    |
| `Ctrl + Enter`        | Run the selected cell(s).                                 |
| `Shift + Enter`       | Run the current cell and select the one below.            |
| `Alt + Enter`         | Run the current cell and insert a new one below.          |
| `Alt + Up/Down`       | Move the current cell up or down.                         |

<!-- ## First Python Program

The "Hello, World!" program is a tradition in programming. It's a simple program that outputs "Hello, World!".

In a code cell in your Jupyter Notebook, type the following and run it:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The `print()` function is a built-in Python function that displays the specified message to the screen. -->

## Basic Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description    | Example     | Result |
| :------- | :------------- | :---------- | :----- |
| `+`      | Addition       | `5 + 2`     | `7`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `5 - 2`     | `3`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `5 * 2`     | `10`   |
| `/`      | Division       | `5 / 2`     | `2.5`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division | `5 // 2`    | `2`    |
| `%`      | Modulus        | `5 % 2`     | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation | `5 ** 2`    | `25`   |

> **Note:** Exponentiation can also be used to take roots. For example, `2 ** 0.5` gives the square root of 2.

### Operator Precedence

When multiple operators are used in a single expression, Python follows a specific order of precedence to determine which operation to perform first. This is often remembered by the acronym **PEMDAS** or **BODMAS**.

*   **P**arentheses `()`
*   **E**xponents `**`
*   **M**ultiplication `*`, **D**ivision `/`, **F**loor Division `//`, **M**odulus `%` (from left to right)
*   **A**ddition `+`, **S**ubtraction `-` (from left to right)

Here is the precedence from highest to lowest:

| Precedence | Operator         | Description                                       |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Highest    | `()`             | Parentheses (for grouping)                        |
|            | `**`             | Exponentiation                                    |
|            | `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` | Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus |
| Lowest     | `+`, `-`         | Addition and Subtraction                          |

**Example:**
![Operator Precedence](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/images/000106.jpg "Operator Precedence Example")

### Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values. They return a Boolean (`True` or `False`).

| Operator | Description              | Example     | Result |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :---------- | :----- |
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `5 == 2`    | `False`|
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `5 != 2`    | `True` |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `5 > 2`     | `True` |
| `<`      | Less than                | `5 < 2`     | `False`|
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 5`    | `True` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `5 <= 2`    | `False`|

> **Note:** Equality is checked with `==`, not `=`.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables are containers for storing data values.

!['Variables'](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/images/000001.jpg)


> **Assignment vs. Equality:** A common point of confusion is the difference between the assignment operator (`=`) and the equality operator (`==`).
>*   The **assignment operator (`=`)** is used to assign a value to a variable.
>*   The **equality operator (`==`)** is used to compare two values and returns a Boolean (`True` or `False`).
>
>    ```python
>    # Assignment: The value 42 is assigned to the variable 'spam'.
>    spam = 42
>
>    # Equality Check: This checks if the value of 'spam' is equal to 42.
>    print(spam == 42) # Output: True
>
>    # This checks if the value of 'spam' is equal to 99.
>    print(spam == 99) # Output: False
>    ```

### Reassignment
![reassignment](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/images/000002.jpg)
```python
spam = 42
spam = 100
print(spam)
# prints 100
```

### Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Example   | Equivalent to |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------ |
| `=`      | `x = 5`   | `x = 5`       |
| `+=`     | `x += 3`  | `x = x + 3`   |
| `-=`     | `x -= 3`  | `x = x - 3`   |
| `*=`     | `x *= 3`  | `x = x * 3`   |
| `/=`     | `x /= 3`  | `x = x / 3`   |
| `//=`    | `x //= 3` | `x = x // 3`  |
| `%=`     | `x %= 3`  | `x = x % 3`   |
| `**=`    | `x **= 3` | `x = x ** 3`  |

### Variable Naming Rules

When naming variables in Python, you must follow these rules:

*   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character (`_`).
*   A variable name cannot start with a number.
*   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (`A-z`, `0-9`, and `_`).
*   Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are three different variables).
*   Avoid using Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `while`, `str`, `int`) as variable names.

**Good Examples:**
```python
my_variable = 10
user_name = "JohnDoe"
_value = 42
```

**Bad Examples:**
```python
2nd_variable = 5  # Cannot start with a number
my-variable = 20  # Cannot contain hyphens
for = "loop"      # "for" is a keyword
```

### Basic Data Types

You can find out the data type of a variable using the `type()` function:
```python
print(type(name))
# Output: <class 'str'>
```

### Summary of Basic Data Types

| Data Type | Description                   | Example              | Key Characteristics                                    |
| :-------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `int`     | Integer numbers               | `-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`           | Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals. |
| `float`   | Floating-point numbers        | `-1.25, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25`      | Numbers with a decimal point.                          |
| `str`     | String (sequence of characters) | `'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', '11 cats'`     | Textual data, enclosed in single or double quotes.     |
| `bool`    | Boolean                       | `True, False`  | Represents `True` or `False`. Used in conditional logic. |
| `NoneType`| Absence of a value            | `None`         | Singleton `None`, falsy; compare with `is` (not `==`). |

### Assigning Differet Data Types to Variables

*   **Integer (`int`):** Whole numbers.
    ```python
    age = 25
    height = 180
    ```
*   **Float (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point.
    ```python
    price = 19.99
    degree = -90.0
    ```
*   **String (`str`):** A sequence of characters, enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    book = "Alice in Wonderland"
    sentence = "I love the movie 'Dune'"
    bad_string = 'I'm using single quotes, but this will create an error'
    ```

> **Note:**
> You can use single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to define strings. However, if the string itself contains quotes, you must use the opposite quote type to avoid errors.

> **Another Note:**
>
> **Number vs. Text:** The integer `1` is a number that you can perform mathematical calculations on. The string `"1"` is a piece of text, a single character.
> 
> ```python
> # Mathematical addition
> print(1 + 1)
> # Output: 2
> 
> # String concatenation
> print("1" + "1")
> # Output: "11"
> ```
> Trying to perform math with a string will result in an error: `1 + "1"` would crash your program.

*   **Boolean (`bool`):** Represents one of two values: `True` or `False`.
    ```python
    is_student = True
    is_teacher = False
    ```

> **Boolean vs. Text:** Similarly, `True` is a special boolean value representing truth. `"True"` is just a four-character string.
> 
> ```python
> is_student = True
> print(is_student)
> # prints True
> print(not is_student)
> # prints False
> ```

*   **NoneType (`None`):** Represents the absence of a value. Often used as a default placeholder or to indicate “no result.”
    ```python
    result = None
    print(result is None)
    # prints True

    gender = None
    print(gender is not None)
    # prints False
    ```

**Why does this matter?**

Data types tell the computer what kind of data it is working with and what operations are allowed. By enforcing these rules, Python helps prevent errors and ensures that our code behaves predictably. Using the correct data type is fundamental to writing correct and efficient programs.

### Type Conversion Functions

| Function | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `int(x)` | Converts x to an integer. |
| `float(x)` | Converts x to a float. |
| `str(x)` | Converts x to a string. |
| `bool(x)` | Converts x to a boolean. |

## Strings in Detail

### String Concatenation

The `+` operator can be used to join two or more strings together. This is known as **string concatenation**.

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
# Output: John Doe
```

### String Replication

The `*` operator can be used to repeat a string multiple times. This is known as **string replication**.

```python
word = "Hello"
repeated_word = word * 3
print(repeated_word)
# Output: HelloHelloHello
```

### Escape Characters

Escape characters are special characters in strings that are not interpreted literally. They are preceded by a backslash (`\`) and allow you to include characters that would otherwise be difficult to represent, such as newlines, tabs, or quotes within a string.

| Escape Character | Description      |
| :--------------- | :--------------- |
| `\'`             | Single quote     |
| `\"`             | Double quote     |
| `\t`             | Tab              |
| `\n`             | Newline          |
| `\\`             | Backslash        |

```python
print('I\'m a string with a single quote.')
# Output: I'm a string with a single quote.
print("She said, \"Hello!\"")
# Output: She said, "Hello!"
print("This is a line.\nThis is a new line.")
# Output: This is a line.
#         This is a new line.
print("This is a backslash: \\")
# Output: This is a backslash: \
```

### String Indexing and Slicing

Strings are ordered sequences of characters. You can access individual characters using an index or a range of characters using slicing.

#### Indexing
Python uses zero-based indexing, where the first character is at index `0`. Negative indexing can be used to access characters from the end of the string, where `-1` is the last character.

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Positive indexing
print(my_string[0])   # Output: H
print(my_string[7])   # Output: W

# Negative indexing
print(my_string[-1])  # Output: !
print(my_string[-6])  # Output: W
```

#### Slicing
Slicing allows you to get a substring. The syntax is `[start:stop]`, where `start` is the index of the first character to include, and `stop` is the index of the character to stop at (it is not included).

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Get 'Hello'
print(my_string[0:5])  # Output: Hello

# Get 'World'
print(my_string[7:12]) # Output: World

# Omitting start defaults to the beginning
print(my_string[:5])   # Output: Hello

# Omitting stop defaults to the end
print(my_string[7:])   # Output: World!
```

#### Slicing with a Step
You can also provide a step size with the syntax `[start:stop:step]`. The step indicates how many characters to jump after retrieving a character.

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Get every second character
print(my_string[::2])  # Output: Hlo ol!

# Get characters from index 1 to 10 with a step of 3
print(my_string[1:10:3]) # Output: eoW

# Reverse a string
print(my_string[::-1]) # Output: !dlroW ,olleH
```

### String Properties

One of the most important properties of strings in Python is that they are **immutable**. This means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Any method that appears to modify a string actually returns a new string with the changes.

**Example of Immutability:**

If you try to change a character in a string, you will get an error:

```python
my_string = "Hello"
# This will cause an error because strings are immutable
# my_string[0] = 'J' # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

To "change" a string, you must create a new one:

```python
my_string = "Hello"
new_string = "J" + my_string[1:]
print(new_string) # Output: Jello
```

### String Functions
| Function | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `len(s)` | Returns the length of the string. |

### String Methods

Strings come with a variety of built-in methods that allow you to perform common operations. These methods return new strings, leaving the original string unchanged.

| Method           | Description                                                 |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.upper()`        | Converts the string to uppercase.                           |
| `.lower()`        | Converts the string to lowercase.                           |
| `.strip()`        | Removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.|
| `.replace(old, new)` | Replaces all occurrences of a substring with another.       |
| `.split(separator)`| Splits the string into a list of substrings.                |
| `.startswith(prefix)`| Returns `True` if the string starts with the specified prefix.|
| `.endswith(suffix)`| Returns `True` if the string ends with the specified suffix.  |

```python
text = "  Hello, World!  "

# Case conversion
print(text.upper()) # Output:   HELLO, WORLD!  
print(text.lower()) # Output:   hello, world!  

# Stripping whitespace
print(text.strip()) # Output: Hello, World!

# Replacing text
print(text.replace("World", "Python")) # Output:   Hello, Python!  

# Splitting a string
sentence = "This is a sentence."
words = sentence.split(' ')
print(words) # Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sentence.']

# Checking start and end
print(text.strip().startswith("Hello")) # Output: True
print(text.strip().endswith("!"))     # Output: True
```

## Basic Input and Output

### Output
As we've seen, the `print()` function is used for output. You can also use f-strings (formatted string literals) for more readable and convenient formatting.

```python
name = "Bob"
age = 40
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
# Output: Bob is 40 years old.
```

### Formatting Options

F-strings support various formatting options:

```python
# Decimal precision for floating-point numbers
pi = 3.14159
print(f"Pi to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")
# Output: Pi to 2 decimal places: 3.14
```

> **Note:** f string formatting of floats always rounds up, so if you want to truncate the decimal places without rounding, you should use alternative techniques, for example:
> ```python
> # Truncate to 2 decimal places without rounding
> import math
> pi = 3.14159
> n = 2
> print(f"Pi to 2 decimal places: {math.trunc(pi * 10**n) / 10**2}")
> # Output: Pi to 2 decimal places: 3.14
> ```

```python
# Width and alignment
print(f"{'Left':<10}|{'Center':^10}|{'Right':>10}")
# Output: Left      |  Center  |     Right

# Number formatting
number = 1234567.89
print(f"Currency: ${number:,.2f}")
# Output: Currency: $1,234,567.89

# Percentage
percentage = 0.8756
print(f"Completion: {percentage:.2%}")
# Output: Completion: 87.56%

# Binary, octal, and hexadecimal
value = 42
print(f"Binary: {value:b}, Hex: {value:x}")
# Output: Binary: 101010, Hex: 2a
```

### Input
The `input()` function allows you to get input from the user. It always returns the data as a string.

```python
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")
```

If you need to perform mathematical operations, you'll need to convert the input string to a number (`int` or `float`).

```python
user_age_str = input("Enter your age: ")
user_age_int = int(user_age_str)
print(f"Next year, you will be {user_age_int + 1} years old.")
```
