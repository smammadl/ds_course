# 1.6: Advanced Data Structures and Iterators - Exercises

This file contains exercises to practice the concepts from lesson 1.6. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions.

## `*args` and `**kwargs`

### Exercise 1: `*args`
1.  Write a function `calculate_average(*args)` that takes any number of numerical arguments.
2.  The function should return the average of all the numbers passed to it.
3.  Test it with `calculate_average(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` and `calculate_average(10, 20)`.

### Exercise 2: `**kwargs`
1.  Write a function `print_profile(**kwargs)` that accepts any number of keyword arguments.
2.  The function should loop through the keyword arguments and print them in the format `key: value`.
3.  Test it by calling `print_profile(name="Alex", age=28, city="New York")`.

### Exercise 3: Combining `*args` and `**kwargs`
1.  Write a function `process_order(customer_name, *items, **details)`.
2.  The function should first print the customer's name.
3.  Then, it should print the list of items ordered.
4.  Finally, it should print any extra details provided (like `delivery_time` or `address`).
5.  Test it with a call like `process_order("Bob", "Pizza", "Coke", delivery_time="6 PM", address="123 Main St")`.

## Generators and Iterators

### Exercise 4: Generator Function
1.  Write a generator function `countdown(start)` that yields numbers from `start` down to 1.
2.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the generator and print each number for a countdown from 5.

### Exercise 5: Generator Expression
1.  You have a list of words: `words = ["hello", "world", "python", "is", "fun"]`.
2.  Use a generator expression to create a generator that yields the length of each word.
3.  Convert the generator to a list and print it.

## Decorators

### Exercise 6: Simple Decorator
1.  Write a decorator called `shout`.
2.  This decorator should take a function that returns a string, and it should make that string uppercase before returning it.
3.  Apply this decorator to a function `greet()` that returns "Hello, I am a function."
4.  Print the result of calling the decorated `greet()` function.

### Exercise 7: Decorator with Arguments
1.  Write a decorator `repeat(n)` that takes an argument `n`.
2.  The decorator should make the decorated function run `n` times.
3.  Apply it to a function `say_hi()` that prints "Hi!".
4.  Test it with `@repeat(3)`.

## Pathlib

### Exercise 8: Pathlib Basics
1.  Import `Path` from `pathlib`.
2.  Print the current working directory using `Path.cwd()`.
3.  Create a `Path` object for a hypothetical file path: `data/processed/log.txt`.
4.  Print the name, parent directory, and suffix (extension) of this path.

### Exercise 9: File Operations with Pathlib
1.  Define a `Path` object for a file named `pathlib_test.txt`.
2.  Use the `write_text()` method to write the string "Hello from Pathlib!" to the file.
3.  Use the `read_text()` method to read the content back and print it.

### Exercise 10: Directory Operations
1.  Define a `Path` object for a directory named `my_new_folder`.
2.  Create this directory using `mkdir(exist_ok=True)`.
3.  Inside this directory, create a file `temp.txt` and write some text to it using pathlib methods (you can use `/` operator to join paths: `file_path = dir_path / "temp.txt"`).
4.  Iterate through the directory using `iterdir()` and print the name of the file you created.

## File I/O and Standard Library

### Exercise 11: Writing and Reading Files
1.  Create a list of strings: `lines_to_write = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]`.
2.  Write these lines to a file named `my_file.txt`. Each string should be on a new line.
3.  Then, read the entire content of `my_file.txt` and print it.

### Exercise 12: `collections.Counter`
1.  From the `collections` module, import `Counter`.
2.  Given the list `votes = ["red", "blue", "red", "green", "blue", "red"]`, use `Counter` to count the votes for each color.
3.  Print the `Counter` object.

### Exercise 13: `itertools.product`
1.  From the `itertools` module, import `product`.
2.  You have two lists: `sizes = ['S', 'M', 'L']` and `colors = ['black', 'white']`.
3.  Use `product` to find all possible combinations of T-shirt sizes and colors.
4.  Print the result as a list of tuples.
